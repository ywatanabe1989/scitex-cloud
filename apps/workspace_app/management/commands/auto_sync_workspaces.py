"""
DEPRECATED: Auto-sync daemon has been removed from the architecture.

New Architecture:
- Manual sync: User runs 'scitex cloud push/pull' from local machine
- Auto backup: Simple rsync snapshots (see: scripts/backup_workspaces.sh)

Reason for removal:
- Auto-git-sync creates dirty commits during editing
- Pollutes Git history with meaningless commits
- Causes merge conflicts in background
- Users have no control over timing

This command is kept for backwards compatibility but does nothing.
