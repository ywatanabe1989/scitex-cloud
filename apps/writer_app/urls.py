Writer App URLs - Feature-based organization.

This file serves as the main entry point for writer_app URLs,
delegating to feature-based URL modules following FULLSTACK.md guidelines.

The URL structure is organized by feature domains:
- Index: Main entry points and workspace management
- Editor: Document editing and section management
- Compilation: LaTeX compilation and PDF generation
- Version Control: Git-based version management
- arXiv: arXiv submission and integration
- Collaboration: Real-time collaborative editing

All routes are defined in their respective feature modules under urls/
