# SciTeX Web Project - Cleanup Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Project Structure Issues
1. Incomplete directory structure lacking standard web project organization
2. Inconsistent git repository state with staged but deleted files
3. Missing source code directories for the web application
4. No testing infrastructure in place

### Git Issues
1. Staged but deleted files in `../literature_review/` directory
2. Unstaged project management files
3. Numerous untracked files and directories
4. Currently on feature branch not following naming convention

## Cleanup Tasks (Prioritized)

### 1. Resolve Git Issues
- [x] Create safety branches (feature/cleanup and checkpoint/before-cleanup)
- [x] Resolve staged but deleted files issue
- [ ] Stage project management files
- [ ] Commit cleanup setup

### 2. Establish Core Directory Structure
- [x] Create standard web application structure:
  - [x] `src/` for application source code
  - [x] `public/` for static assets
  - [x] `tests/` for test files
  - [x] `docs/` for documentation (already exists)
  - [x] `config/` for configuration files
  - [x] `.old/` for safely archived files

### 3. Standardize File Naming
- [x] Review and rename any files with development patterns (-v01, -fix, etc.)
- [x] Apply consistent naming conventions to all files
- [x] Organize files into appropriate directories

### 4. Clean Up Documentation
- [x] Review and organize documentation files
- [x] Ensure all guidelines are properly referenced and available
- [x] Update project management files with cleanup progress

### 5. Clean Up Source Code
- [x] Apply Clean Code principles to any existing source code
- [x] Remove or safely archive obsolete files
- [x] Establish coding standards for the project

### 6. Create Basic Web Application Structure
- [x] Set up Django application structure
- [x] Create frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- [x] Implement basic test structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- Organized directory structure following web application standards
- Clean git repository with properly tracked files
- Updated project management files documenting the cleanup
- Clear path for future development following Test-Driven approach

## Next Steps After Cleanup
1. Update USER_PLAN.md with detailed project plan
2. Set up test-driven development environment
3. Begin feature development on a clean foundation
