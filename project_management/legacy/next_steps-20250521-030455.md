# SciTeX Web Project - Next Steps

## Priority Tasks
1. **Collaborate with user to populate USER_PLAN.md**
   - Need detailed project description
   - Define timeline and milestones
   - Clarify resources and success criteria

2. **Resolve git status issues**
   - Current status shows staged but deleted files in literature_review
   - Determine if these should be committed or removed
   - Implement proper git workflow according to version control guidelines

3. **Render Mermaid diagram**
   - Use `.claude/bin/render_mermaid.sh` to create SVG visualization
   - Create visual progress tracking

4. **Prepare for code organization**
   - Follow Clean Code principles from guidelines
   - Plan directory structure for the project
   - Establish testing methodology

## Questions for User
1. What is the current status of files in "../literature_review/" that appear as staged but deleted?
2. What are the specific goals, timeline, and milestones for the SciTeX Web Project?
3. Should we continue on the current feature branch (feature/SciTeX-PaperReview) or create a new one?

## Git Next Steps
- Once project plan is filled, commit project management files
- Follow version control workflow from guidelines
- Ensure we're working on correct branch (develop → feature branch)
