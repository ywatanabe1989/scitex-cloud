## Writing Guidelines for Future Content

### Tone and Voice
- **Professional** yet approachable
- **Clear** without being simplistic
- **Enthusiastic** about science without hyperbole
- **Inclusive** and accessible to global audiences

### Key Principles
1. **Active voice**: "SciTeX accelerates research" not "Research is accelerated by SciTeX"
2. **Concrete benefits**: "Reduce analysis time by 70%" not "Save time"
3. **User-focused**: "You can..." rather than "SciTeX allows..."
4. **Plain English**: Avoid jargon except where technically necessary

### Common Replacements
- "Utilize" → "Use"
- "Facilitate" → "Enable" or "Help"
- "Implement" → "Add" or "Create"
- "Leverage" → "Use" or "Build on"
- "Functionality" → "Features" or "Tools"
