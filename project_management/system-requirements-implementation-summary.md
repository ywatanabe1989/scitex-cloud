# System Requirements Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-05-23
**Status**: Completed

## Overview

Successfully clarified and documented system requirements for all SciTeX ecosystem components, with special attention to:
- SciTeX-Engine's dependency on Claude Code
- SciTeX-Viz's dependency on Windows and SigmaPlot
- Linux compatibility and Apptainer containerization strategy

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Feature Request Document
- **File**: `/project_management/feature_requests/feature-request-system-requirements-clarification.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive feature request outlining the need for clear system requirements documentation

### 2. Created System Requirements Documentation
- **File**: `/docs/SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Content**: Detailed system requirements for all SciTeX components including:
  - Platform compatibility
  - Dependencies (both open source and proprietary)
  - Container availability (Docker/Apptainer)
  - Licensing information
  - Hardware requirements
  - Support matrix

### 3. Updated Product Pages

#### SciTeX-Engine (`/apps/cloud_app/templates/cloud_app/products/engine.html`)
- Already had system requirements section
- Verified content aligns with new documentation

#### SciTeX-Doc (`/apps/cloud_app/templates/cloud_app/products/doc.html`)
- Already had system requirements section
- Verified content aligns with new documentation

#### SciTeX-Code (`/apps/cloud_app/templates/cloud_app/products/code.html`)
- Added comprehensive system requirements section
- Included platform compatibility, dependencies, container info, and licensing

#### SciTeX-Viz (`/apps/cloud_app/templates/cloud_app/products/viz.html`)
- Added detailed system requirements section
- Clearly stated Windows/SigmaPlot dependency
- Included note about Linux compatibility via Apptainer
- Mentioned future open-source alternative in development

### 4. Created Freemium Pricing Strategy
- **File**: `/docs/FREEMIUM_PRICING_STRATEGY.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive pricing strategy balancing open science promotion with sustainability
- **Key Features**:
  - Four tiers: Open Science (Free), Researcher ($19/mo), Team ($49/user/mo), Institution (Custom)
  - Clear feature comparison table
  - Sustainability mechanisms and growth projections
  - Ethical commitments to open science

### 5. Updated CSS for Requirements Sections
- **File**: `/static/css/pages/products.css`
- **Added**: Styling for `.requirements-section`, `.requirements-grid`, and `.req-card` classes
- **Result**: Consistent, professional appearance for all system requirements sections

## Key Insights

1. **Containerization Strategy**: All components will be available as Apptainer containers, enabling Linux deployment even for Windows-dependent tools

2. **Licensing Clarity**: Clear distinction between open-source components (MIT/GPL) and proprietary dependencies (Claude Code, SigmaPlot)

3. **Future Direction**: Active development of open-source alternatives to proprietary dependencies, particularly for SciTeX-Viz

4. **Sustainability Model**: Well-balanced freemium approach that keeps core tools free while generating revenue from power users and institutions

## Next Steps

1. Implement Apptainer container definitions for each component
2. Test containerized versions on various Linux distributions
3. Create user guides for container deployment
4. Begin development of open-source SigmaPlot alternative
5. Set up container registry for distribution

## Impact

This implementation provides users with:
- Clear expectations about system requirements
- Multiple deployment options (native, container, cloud)
- Transparency about proprietary dependencies
- Path forward for fully open-source ecosystem

The documentation supports the project's goals of promoting open science while maintaining technical excellence and sustainability.
