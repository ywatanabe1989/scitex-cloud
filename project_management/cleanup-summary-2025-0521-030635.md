## Current Project Status
The project has been restructured following clean code principles and now has:

1. A clear, standardized directory structure
2. Basic Django web application setup
3. Frontend templates and styling
4. Test framework in place
5. Dependency management established

## Remaining Issues
- Git repository has some configuration issues with the lock file that need to be resolved
- Need to fill in USER_PLAN.md with detailed project requirements
- The project is not yet integrated with other SciTeX components

## Next Steps Recommendation
