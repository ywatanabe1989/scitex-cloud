# Feature Request: Enhanced Code Page with Sample Features

## Summary
Enhance the Code page with a proper hero section, sample features, and professional presentation for reproducible scientific code organization.

## Feature Request Details

### Problem Statement
- **Issue**: Current Code page only shows "Coming Soon" message
- **Impact**: Users don't understand Code capabilities or see examples  
- **Goal**: Professional showcase of scientific code organization features

### Scope
- **Hero Section**: Professional hero with "SciTeX Code" and "Reproducible, standardized scientific code organization using python scitex package"
- **Sample Features**: Add sample code organization with links (similar to previous implementation)
- **Coming Soon Status**: Maintain "Coming Soon" indication while showing preview capabilities

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Hero Section**:
   - Title: "SciTeX Code" (keeping SciTeX here as it's the proper module name)
   - Subtitle: "Reproducible, standardized scientific code organization using python scitex package"
   - Use appropriate hero gradient styling

2. **Sample Features**:
   - Add sample scientific code organization examples
   - Include links to examples or demos
   - Showcase typical scientific programming capabilities

3. **Coming Soon Badge**:
   - Maintain "Coming Soon" status
   - Position appropriately with sample content

## Technical Implementation

### Priority: Medium
This improves user understanding of Code capabilities and provides preview of features.

### Areas to Implement:
1. **Code Index Page**:
   - Enhanced hero section with proper branding
   - Sample feature gallery
   - Professional presentation

2. **Sample Content**:
   - Scientific code organization examples
   - SCITEX package integration demonstrations
   - Interactive elements or links where appropriate

3. **Design Consistency**:
   - Follow SciTeX design system
   - Use hero gradients appropriately
   - Maintain professional scientific appearance

## User Story
As a researcher visiting SciTeX Code, I want to see what reproducible code organization capabilities are available so that I understand the value and features of the Code module.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Hero section displays "SciTeX Code" and "Reproducible, standardized scientific code organization using python scitex package"
- [x] Sample features are displayed with appropriate links
- [x] "Coming Soon" status is maintained
- [x] Page follows SciTeX design system and hero gradient styling
- [x] Sample content showcases scientific code organization capabilities
