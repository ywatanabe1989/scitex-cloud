# Feature Request: Remove Redundant SciTeX Branding

## Summary
Remove redundant "SciTeX" branding from the dashboard and other areas to reduce visual clutter and avoid wasting user attention.

## Feature Request Details

### Problem Statement
- **Issue**: Redundant "SciTeX" branding appears in multiple places, particularly in the dashboard
- **Impact**: Creates visual clutter and wastes user attention
- **Goal**: Clean, focused interface without unnecessary repetition

### Scope
- **Primary Target**: Dashboard page - remove redundant "SciTeX" text/branding
- **Secondary Areas**: Review other pages for similar redundant branding
- **Principle**: No duplication needed - if SciTeX is already clear from context, don't repeat it

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Dashboard Cleanup**:
   - Remove redundant "SciTeX" text from dashboard elements
   - Keep essential branding only where contextually necessary
   - Maintain clear hierarchy without repetitive labels

2. **Site-wide Review**:
   - Audit all pages for redundant branding
   - Apply consistent "no duplication" principle
   - Focus user attention on functionality, not repetitive branding

3. **Branding Strategy**:
   - Maintain brand identity without over-repetition
   - Use SciTeX branding strategically (header, key locations)
   - Avoid redundant mentions in obvious contexts

## Technical Implementation

### Priority: Medium
This improves user experience by reducing visual noise and focusing attention.

### Areas to Review:
1. **Dashboard**:
   - Module cards - remove redundant "SciTeX" prefixes
   - Statistics sections
   - Welcome messages
   - Navigation elements

2. **Module Pages**:
   - Remove redundant "SciTeX Scholar", "SciTeX Writer" if context is clear
   - Keep branding where it adds value or clarity

3. **Templates**:
   - Update base templates to avoid repetitive branding
   - Create consistent branding guidelines for developers
