# Feature Request: Enhanced Viz Page with Sample Figures

## Summary
Enhance the Viz page with a proper hero section, sample figures, and professional presentation for publication-ready graphing capabilities.

## Feature Request Details

### Problem Statement
- **Issue**: Current Viz page only shows "Coming Soon" message
- **Impact**: Users don't understand Viz capabilities or see examples

### Scope
- **Hero Section**: Professional hero with "SciTeX Viz" and "Publication-ready, high quality graphing"
- **Sample Figures**: Add sample visualizations with links (similar to previous implementation)
- **Coming Soon Status**: Maintain "Coming Soon" indication while showing preview capabilities

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Hero Section**:
   - Title: "SciTeX Viz" (keeping SciTeX here as it's the proper module name)
   - Subtitle: "Publication-ready, high quality graphing"
   - Use appropriate hero gradient styling

2. **Sample Figures**:
   - Add sample scientific visualizations
   - Include links to examples or demos
   - Showcase typical scientific graphing capabilities

3. **Coming Soon Badge**:
   - Maintain "Coming Soon" status
   - Position appropriately with sample content

## Technical Implementation
