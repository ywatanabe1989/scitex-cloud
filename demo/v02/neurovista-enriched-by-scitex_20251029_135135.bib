  abstract = {Objective: Forecasting epileptic seizures can reduce uncertainty for patients and allow preventative actions. While many models can predict the occurrence of seizures from features of the EEG, few models incorporate changes in features over time. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are a machine learning architecture that can display temporal dynamics due to the recurrent connections. In this paper, we used LSTMs to monitor changes in EEG features over time to improve the accuracy of seizure forecasts and to alter the time window of the forecast. Methods: Long-term intracranial EEG recordings from eight patients from the NeuroVista dataset were used. A Fourier transform of 1-minute segments of EEG was fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The outputs from the CNN were input to three different LSTM models at different time intervals: 1 minute, 1 hour and 1 day. The LSTM model outputs were used to predict seizure onset within a time window. The prediction and start of the time window were separated by the same length of time as the window. Window sizes tested included 2, 4, 10, 20 and 40 minutes. Results and Conclusion: Our model forecast seizure onsets well above a random predictor. Compared to other models using the same dataset, our model performed better for some patients and worse for others. Monitoring the change in EEG features over time allowed our model to produce good results over a range of different window sizes, which is an improvement on previous models and raises the possibility of altering the forecast to meet individual patient needs. Furthermore, a window size of 40 minutes provides a potential intervention time of 40 minutes, which is the first time an intervention time of more than 5 minutes have been forecast using long-term EEG recordings.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy affects millions worldwide, posing significant challenges due to the erratic and unexpected nature of seizures. Despite advancements, existing seizure prediction techniques remain limited in their ability to forecast seizures with high accuracy, impacting the quality of life for those with epilepsy. This research introduces the Coherence-based Seizure Prediction (CoSP) method, which integrates coherence analysis with deep learning to enhance seizure prediction efficacy. In CoSP, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are divided into 10-second segments to extract channel pairwise coherence. This coherence data is then used to train a four-layer convolutional neural network to predict the probability of being in a preictal state. The predicted probabilities are then processed to issue seizure warnings. CoSP was evaluated in a pseudo-prospective setting using long-term iEEG data from ten patients in the NeuroVista seizure advisory system. CoSP demonstrated promising predictive performance across a range of preictal intervals (4 to 180 minutes). CoSP achieved a median Seizure Sensitivity (SS) of 0.79, a median false alarm rate of 0.15 per hour, and a median Time in Warning (TiW) of 27%, highlighting its potential for accurate and reliable seizure prediction. Statistical analysis confirmed that CoSP significantly outperformed chance (p = 0.001) and other baseline methods (p <0.05) under similar evaluation configurations.},

  abstract = {Seizure forecasting has the potential to create new therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, such as providing patient warnings and delivering preemptive therapy. Progress on seizure forecasting, however, has been hindered by lack of sufficient data to rigorously evaluate the hypothesis that seizures are preceded by physiological changes, and are not simply random events. We investigated seizure forecasting in three dogs with naturally occurring focal epilepsy implanted with a device recording continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG). The iEEG spectral power in six frequency bands: delta (0.1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), low-gamma (30–70 Hz), and high-gamma (70–180 Hz), were used as features. Logistic regression classifiers were trained to discriminate labeled pre-ictal and inter-ictal data segments using combinations of the band spectral power features. Performance was assessed on separate test data sets via 10-fold cross-validation. A total of 125 spontaneous seizures were detected in continuous iEEG recordings spanning 6.5 to 15 months from 3 dogs. When considering all seizures, the seizure forecasting algorithm performed significantly better than a Poisson-model chance predictor constrained to have the same time in warning for all 3 dogs over a range of total warning times. Seizure clusters were observed in all 3 dogs, and when the effect of seizure clusters was decreased by considering the subset of seizures separated by at least 4 hours, the forecasting performance remained better than chance for a subset of algorithm parameters. These results demonstrate that seizures in canine epilepsy are not randomly occurring events, and highlight the feasibility of long-term seizure forecasting using iEEG monitoring.},

               <jats:p>Early implantable epilepsy therapy devices provided open-loop electrical stimulation without brain sensing, computing, or an interface for synchronized behavioural inputs from patients. Recent epilepsy stimulation devices provide brain sensing but have not yet developed analytics for accurately tracking and quantifying behaviour and seizures. Here we describe a distributed brain co-processor providing an intuitive bi-directional interface between patient, implanted neural stimulation and sensing device, and local and distributed computing resources. Automated analysis of continuous streaming electrophysiology is synchronized with patient reports using a handheld device and integrated with distributed cloud computing resources for quantifying seizures, interictal epileptiform spikes and patient symptoms during therapeutic electrical brain stimulation. The classification algorithms for interictal epileptiform spikes and seizures were developed and parameterized using long-term ambulatory data from nine humans and eight canines with epilepsy, and then implemented prospectively in out-of-sample testing in two pet canines and four humans with drug-resistant epilepsy living in their natural environments. Accurate seizure diaries are needed as the primary clinical outcome measure of epilepsy therapy and to guide brain-stimulation optimization. The brain co-processor system described here enables tracking interictal epileptiform spikes, seizures and correlation with patient behavioural reports. In the future, correlation of spikes and seizures with behaviour will allow more detailed investigation of the clinical impact of spikes and seizures on patients.</jats:p>},

This study characterizes circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in dogs with naturally occurring focal epilepsy, and considers the implications of an animal model for the study of seizure risk patterns, seizure forecasting and personalized treatment protocols. In this retrospective cohort study, 16 dogs were continuously monitored with ambulatory intracranial EEG devices designed for humans. Detailed medication records were kept for all dogs. Seizure periodicity was evaluated with circular statistics methods. Circular non-uniformity was assessed for circadian, 7-day and approximately monthly periods. The Rayleigh test was used to assess statistical significance, with correction for multiple comparisons. Seizure clusters were evaluated with Fano factor (index of dispersion) measurements, and compared to a Poisson distribution. Relationships between interseizure interval (ISI) and seizure duration were evaluated. Six dogs met the inclusion criteria of having at least 30 seizures and were monitored for an average of 65 weeks. Three dogs had seizures with circadian seizure periodicity, one dog had a 7-day periodicity, and two dogs had approximately monthly periodicity. Four dogs had seizure clusters and significantly elevated Fano factor values. There were subject-specific differences in the dynamics of ISI and seizure durations, both within and between lead and clustered seizure categories. Our findings show that seizure timing in dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy is not random, and that circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters are common. Circadian, 7-day, and monthly seizure periodicities occur independent of antiseizure medication dosing, and these patterns likely reflect endogenous rhythms of seizure risk.</jats:p>},

Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been a cornerstone of diagnosis and classification in human epilepsy, but because of several technical challenges has played a smaller clinical role in canine epilepsy. The interictal (between seizures) and ictal (seizure) EEG recorded from the epileptic mammalian brain shows characteristic electrophysiologic biomarkers that are very useful for clinical management.

Closed-loop implantable neural stimulators are an exciting treatment option for patients with medically refractory epilepsy, with a number of new devices in or nearing clinical trials. These devices must accurately detect a variety of seizure types in order to reliably deliver therapeutic stimulation. While effective, broadly-applicable seizure detection algorithms have recently been published, these methods are too computationally intensive to be directly deployed in an implantable device. We demonstrate a strategy that couples devices to cloud computing resources in order to implement complex seizure detection methods on an implantable device platform. Approach. We use a sensitive gating algorithm capable of running on-board a device to identify potential seizure epochs and transmit these epochs to a cloud-based analysis platform. A precise seizure detection algorithm is then applied to the candidate epochs, leveraging cloud computing resources for accurate seizure event detection. This seizure detection strategy was developed and tested on eleven human implanted device recordings generated using the NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System. Main results. The gating algorithm achieved high-sensitivity detection using a small feature set as input to a linear classifier, compatible with the computational capability of next-generation implantable devices. The cloud-based precision algorithm successfully identified all seizures transmitted by the gating algorithm while significantly reducing the false positive rate. Across all subjects, this joint approach detected 99% of seizures with a false positive rate of 0.03 h−1. Significance. We present a novel framework for implementing computationally intensive algorithms on human data recorded from an implanted device. By using telemetry to intelligently access cloud-based computational resources, the next generation of neuro-implantable devices will leverage sophisticated algorithms with potential to greatly improve device performance and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Many biological processes are modulated by rhythms on circadian and multidien timescales. In focal epilepsy, various seizure features, such as spread and duration, can change from one seizure to the next within the same patient. However, the specific timescales of this variability, as well as the specific seizure characteristics that change over time, are unclear.   Methods: Here, in a cross-sectional observational study, we analysed within-patient seizure variability in 10 patients with chronic intracranial EEG recordings (185-767 days of recording time, 57-452 analysed seizures/patient). We characterised the seizure evolutions as sequences of a finite number of patient-specific functional seizure network states (SNSs). We then compared SNS occurrence and duration to (1) time since implantation and (2) patient-specific circadian and multidien cycles in interictal spike rate.   Results: In most patients, the occurrence or duration of at least one SNS was associated with the time since implantation. Some patients had one or more SNSs that were associated with phases of circadian and/or multidien spike rate cycles. A given SNS's occurrence and duration were usually not associated with the same timescale.   Discussion: Our results suggest that different time-varying factors modulate within-patient seizure evolutions over multiple timescales, with separate processes modulating a SNS's occurrence and duration. These findings imply that the development of time-adaptive treatments in epilepsy must account for several separate properties of epileptic seizures, and similar principles likely apply to other neurological conditions.},

While the strength of the relationship between seizure pathways and durations was highly subject-specific, in most subjects, changes in seizure pathways were only weakly to moderately associated with differences in seizure durations. The relationship between seizure pathways and durations was strengthened by seizures that were ‘truncated’ versions, both in pathway and duration, of other seizures. However, the relationship was weakened by seizures that had a common pathway, but different durations (‘elasticity’), or had similar durations, but followed different pathways (‘semblance’). Even in subjects with distinct populations of short and long seizures, seizure durations were not a reliable indicator of different seizure pathways. These findings suggest that seizure pathways and durations are modulated by multiple different mechanisms. Uncovering such mechanisms may reveal novel therapeutic targets for reducing seizure duration and severity.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy brain. However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice.},

Theoretical interpretations considering the brain as a dynamical system suggest that prior to a seizure, recorded brain signals may exhibit critical slowing down, a warning signal preceding many critical transitions in dynamical systems. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we monitored key signatures of critical slowing down prior to seizures. The metrics used to detect critical slowing down fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing down is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.</jats:p>},

However, state-of-the-art algorithm design relies on accessing adequate long-term data. Crowd-sourcing ecosystems leverage quality data to enable cost-effective, rapid development of predictive algorithms. A crowd-sourcing ecosystem for seizure prediction is presented involving an international competition, a follow-up held-out data evaluation, and an online platform, Epilepsyecosystem.org, for yielding further improvements in prediction performance. Crowd-sourced algorithms were obtained via the 'Melbourne-University AES-MathWorks-NIH Seizure Prediction Challenge' conducted at kaggle.com. Long-term continuous intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (442 days of recordings and 211 lead seizures per patient) from prediction-resistant patients who had the lowest seizure prediction performances from the NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System clinical trial were analysed. Contestants (646 individuals in 478 teams) from around the world developed algorithms to distinguish between 10-min inter-seizure versus pre-seizure data clips. Over 10 000 algorithms were submitted. The top algorithms as determined by using the contest data were evaluated on a much larger held-out dataset. The data and top algorithms are available online for further investigation and development. The top performing contest entry scored 0.81 area under the classification curve. The performance reduced by only 6.7% on held-out data. Many other teams also showed high prediction reproducibility. Pseudo-prospective evaluation demonstrated that many algorithms, when used alone or weighted by circadian information, performed better than the benchmarks, including an average increase in sensitivity of 1.9 times the original clinical trial sensitivity for matched time in warning. These results indicate that clinically-relevant seizure prediction is possible in a wider range of patients than previously thought possible. Moreover, different algorithms performed best for different patients, supporting the use of patient-specific algorithms and long-term monitoring. The crowd-sourcing ecosystem for seizure prediction will enable further worldwide community study of the data to yield greater improvements in prediction performance by way of competition, collaboration and synergism.10.1093/brain/awy210_video1awy210media15817489051001.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {It is now established that epilepsy is characterized by periodic dynamics that increase seizure likelihood at certain times of day, and which are highly patient-specific. However, these dynamics are not typically incorporated into seizure prediction algorithms due to the difficulty of estimating patient-specific rhythms from relatively short-term or unreliable data sources. This work outlines a novel framework to develop and assess seizure forecasts, and demonstrates that the predictive power of forecasting models is improved by circadian information. The analyses used long-term, continuous electrocorticography from nine subjects, recorded for an average of 320 days each. We used a large amount of out-of-sample data (a total of 900 days for algorithm training, and 2879 days for testing), enabling the most extensive post hoc investigation into seizure forecasting. We compared the results of an electrocorticography-based logistic regression model, a circadian probability, and a combined electrocorticography and circadian model. For all subjects, clinically relevant seizure prediction results were significant, and the addition of circadian information (combined model) maximized performance across a range of outcome measures. These results represent a proof-of-concept for implementing a circadian forecasting framework, and provide insight into new approaches for improving seizure prediction algorithms. The circadian framework adds very little computational complexity to existing prediction algorithms, and can be implemented using current-generation implant devices, or even non-invasively via surface electrodes using a wearable application. The ability to improve seizure prediction algorithms through straightforward, patient-specific modifications provides promise for increased quality of life and improved safety for patients with epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives Reliable seizure forecasting has important implications in epilepsy treatment and improving the quality of lives for people with epilepsy. High-frequency activity (HFA) is a biomarker that has received significant attention over the past 2 decades, but its predictive value in seizure forecasting remains uncertain. This work aimed to determine the utility of HFA in seizure forecasting. Methods We used seizure data and HFA (80–170 Hz) data obtained from long-term, continuous intracranial EEG recordings of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Instantaneous rates and phases of HFA cycles were used as features for seizure forecasting. Seizure forecasts based on each individual HFA feature, and with the use of a combined approach, were generated pseudo-prospectively (causally). To compute the instantaneous phases for pseudo-prospective forecasting, real-time phase estimation based on an autoregressive model was used. Features were combined with a weighted average approach. The performance of seizure forecasting was primarily evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). Results Of 15 studied patients (median recording duration 557 days, median seizures 151), 12 patients with >10 seizures after 100 recording days were included in the pseudo-prospective analysis. The presented real-time phase estimation is feasible and can causally estimate the instantaneous phases of HFA cycles with high accuracy. Pseudo-prospective seizure forecasting based on HFA rates and phases performed significantly better than chance in 11 of 12 patients, although there were patient-specific differences. Combining rate and phase information improved forecasting performance compared to using either feature alone. The combined forecast using the best-performing channel yielded a median AUC of 0.70, a median sensitivity of 0.57, and a median specificity of 0.77. Discussion These findings show that HFA could be useful for seizure forecasting and represent proof of concept for using prior information of patient-specific relationships between HFA and seizures in pseudo-prospective forecasting. Future seizure forecasting algorithms might benefit from the inclusion of HFA, and the real-time phase estimation approach can be extended to other biomarkers. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that HFA (80–170 Hz) in long-term continuous intracranial EEG can be useful to forecast seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epilepsy affects 1% of the global population, with approximately one-third of patients resistant to anti-seizure medications (ASMs), posing risks of physical injuries and psychological issues. Seizure prediction algorithms aim to enhance the quality of life for these individuals by providing timely alerts. This study presents a patient-specific seizure prediction algorithm applied to diverse databases (EPILEPSIAE, CHB-MIT, AES, and Epilepsy Ecosystem). The proposed algorithm undergoes a standardized framework, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, training, testing, and postprocessing. Various databases necessitate adaptations in the algorithm, considering differences in data availability and characteristics. The algorithm exhibited variable performance across databases, taking into account sensitivity, FPR/h, specificity, and AUC score. This study distinguishes between sample-based approaches, which often yield better results by disregarding the temporal aspect of seizures, and alarm-based approaches, which aim to simulate real-life conditions but produce less favorable outcomes. Statistical assessment reveals challenges in surpassing chance levels, emphasizing the rarity of seizure events. Comparative analyses with existing studies highlight the complexity of standardized assessments, given diverse methodologies and dataset variations. Rigorous methodologies aiming to simulate real-life conditions produce less favorable outcomes, emphasizing the importance of realistic assumptions and comprehensive, long-term, and systematically structured datasets for future research.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Predicting future system behaviour from past observed behaviour (time series) is fundamental to science and engineering. In computational neuroscience, the prediction of future epileptic seizures from brain activity measurements, using EEG data, remains largely unresolved despite much dedicated research effort. Based on a longitudinal and state-of-the-art data set using intercranial EEG measurements from people with epilepsy, we consider the automated discovery of predictive features (or biomarkers) to forecast seizures in a patient-specific way. To this end, we use the path signature, a recent development in the analysis of data streams, to map from measured time series to seizure prediction. The predictor is based on linear classification, here augmented with sparsity constraints, to discern time series with and without an impending seizure. This approach may be seen as a step towards a generic pattern recognition pipeline where the main advantages are simplicity and ease of customisation, while maintaining forecasting performance on par with modern machine learning. Nevertheless, it turns out that although the path signature method has some powerful theoretical guarantees, appropriate time series statistics can achieve essentially the same results in our context of seizure prediction. This suggests that, due to their inherent complexity and non-stationarity, the brain's dynamics are not identifiable from the available EEG measurement data, and, more concretely, epileptic episode prediction is not reliably achieved using EEG measurement data alone.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a model inversion algorithm for electrocorticography (ECoG) data recorded during epileptic seizures. The states and parameters of neural mass models were tracked during a total of over 3000 seizures from twelve patients with focal epilepsy. These models provide an estimate of the effective connectivity within intracortical circuits over the time course of seizures. Observing the dynamics of effective connectivity provides insight into mechanisms of seizures. Estimation of patients seizure dynamics revealed: 1) a highly stereotyped pattern of evolution for each patient, 2) distinct sub-groups of onset mechanisms amongst patients, and 3) different offset mechanisms for long and short seizures. Stereotypical dynamics suggest that, once initiated, seizures follow a deterministic path through the parameter space of a neural model. Furthermore, distinct sub-populations of patients were identified based on characteristic motifs in the dynamics at seizure onset. There were also distinct patterns between long and short duration seizures that were related to seizure offset. Understanding how these different patterns of seizure evolution arise may provide new insights into brain function and guide treatment for epilepsy, since specific therapies may have preferential effects on the various parameters that could potentially be individualized. Methods that unite computational models with data provide a powerful means to generate testable hypotheses for further experimental research. This work provides a demonstration that the hidden connectivity parameters of a neural mass model can be dynamically inferred from data. Our results underscore the power of theoretical models to inform epilepsy management. It is our hope that this work guides further efforts to apply computational models to clinical data.},
