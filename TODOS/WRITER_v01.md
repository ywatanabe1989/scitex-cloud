## TODO
Our aims is to create an coordinated ecosystem for scientific projects.
For the Writer module (http://127.0.0.1:8000/ywatanabe1989/neurovista/?mode=writer), we can learn from overleaf (./externals/overleaf).

Please check current implementations and make a plan for us to improve, and excel overleaf
