## How Users can work with THEIR data

1. Work with git hosting
- [ ] Implement Gitea to host git
  - [ ] Users can use this webapp like GitHub/GitLab/Bitbacket
  - [ ] ssh git@scitex.ai

2. Work with sshing
- [ ] Allow users to ssh to the server and work directory there
- [ ] Security issues
  - [ ] Singularity
  - [ ] SLURM
  - [ ] LDAP? Sorry, I am not good at this
- [ ] This enables powerusers, like Emacs users, can directly work with THEIR data
  - [ ] Allow sftp
  - [ ] Allow rsync as well
