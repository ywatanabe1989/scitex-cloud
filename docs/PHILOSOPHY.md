🚀 SciTeX Design Doctrine

SciTeX MUST be Easy.

1. Intuitive

Zero learning curve

Users should understand the interface without reading documentation

UX must guide users naturally through the workflow

2. Bidirectional Low Migration Cost

Easy to adopt

Easy to leave

No lock-in

Standard, open formats everywhere

Import/export must always be frictionless

3. Simplicity

No unnecessary concepts

Minimal configuration

Clear mental model

Complexity only when absolutely needed

4. Modular Synergy

Each module stands independently (Writer, Scholar, Agent, Viz, Code, Engine…)

No module should require another to function

BUT… when combined, modules should amplify each other

“Better together, but fully functional alone”
