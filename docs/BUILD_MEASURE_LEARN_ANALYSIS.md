# Build-Measure-Learn Analysis: SciTeX Cloud
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Screenshots captured from:** http://127.0.0.1:8000

## 1. BUILD - What We've Built

### Current Features (From Screenshots)

#### Home Page
- **Value Proposition:** "Accelerate Our Research"
- **Key Messages:**
  - 100% open-sourced research tools
  - Customizable to your workflow
  - Deploy locally, in the cloud, or self-hosted
  - Built by researchers, for researchers
- **SciTeX Ecosystem Overview:**
  - Scholar (Literature discovery & analysis)
  - Writer (AI-enhanced scientific writing)
  - Code (Data analysis & computing)
  - Viz (Publication-quality graphics)
- All tools have "View on GitHub" links

#### Scholar Module
- **Working Features:**
  - Search interface with keyword input
  - Multiple source selection (All Sources, PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv, Semantic Scholar)
  - Quick filters (Open Access Only, Last 5 Years, High Impact IF > 5)
  - Advanced Filters option
  - BibTeX enrichment feature (upload .bib files for citation counts, impact factors, PDFs)

#### Authentication System
- Login page with username/email and password
- "Remember me" functionality
- Password reset link
- Sign up link for new users
- Error handling (showing both success and error states)

#### Issues Identified
1. **404 Error on /projects:** "No User matches the given query" - indicates authentication/user profile wrapper issue
2. **Writer & Viz redirect to login:** Require authentication

## 2. MEASURE - Metrics to Track

### User Engagement Metrics (Suggested)

#### Acquisition
- [ ] Sign-up conversion rate
- [ ] Source of user acquisition (organic, referral, etc.)
- [ ] Time from landing to sign-up

#### Activation
- [ ] First project creation rate
- [ ] Time to first value (using Scholar, Writer, Code, or Viz)
- [ ] Module adoption rate (% using each tool)

#### Retention
- [ ] Daily/Weekly/Monthly active users
- [ ] Feature stickiness (return rate per module)
- [ ] Project continuation rate

#### Technical Health
- [ ] Error rate by page/module
- [ ] API response times (especially Scholar searches)
- [ ] External API success rates (PubMed, Semantic Scholar, etc.)

#### Feature Usage
- [ ] Scholar searches per user
- [ ] BibTeX enrichments completed
- [ ] Documents written in Writer
- [ ] Visualizations created in Viz
- [ ] Code executions/analyses run

### Critical Issues to Measure
1. **URL routing errors** (like /projects 404)
2. **Authentication flow success rate**
3. **Anonymous user feature access** (vs. authenticated)

---

## 3. LEARN - Key Learnings & Next Steps

### Critical Fixes Needed

#### High Priority
1. **Fix /projects URL routing**
   - Error: `apps.project_app.user_urls.user_profile_wrapper`
   - Root cause: User query failing when no user is authenticated
   - Action: Implement proper anonymous user handling or redirect

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Both success and error messages showing simultaneously
   - Needs UX improvement for clearer state management

3. **Guest Access Strategy**
   - Decision needed: Which features should work without login?
   - Current state: Scholar works, Writer/Viz require login
   - Per CLAUDE.md: "basic functionalities should be offered to anonymous users"

### Design & UX Learnings

#### Strengths
- Clean, professional design aligned with GitHub aesthetic
- Clear value proposition on home page
- Integrated ecosystem messaging
- Good filter options in Scholar

#### Areas for Improvement
- Projects page needs user-friendly error handling
- Consider progressive disclosure (try before login)
- Add onboarding flow for new users
- Consider demo/sandbox mode for anonymous users

### Technical Architecture Learnings

#### What's Working
- Modular app structure (`apps/XXX_app/`)
- External tools integration (`./externals/SciTeX-*`)
- GitHub branding and community focus

#### What Needs Attention
- User authentication middleware/decorators consistency
- Error page customization (make 404s helpful, not scary)
- URL pattern organization across apps

## 4. NEXT ITERATION - Proposed Actions

### Sprint 1: Core Functionality (Week 1-2)
1. **Fix Critical Bugs**
   - [ ] Resolve /projects 404 error
   - [ ] Fix authentication message display
   - [ ] Implement proper anonymous user routing

2. **Guest Experience**
   - [ ] Define which features work without login
   - [ ] Add "Try SciTeX Scholar" demo mode
   - [ ] Create sample project for demo purposes

### Sprint 2: Measurement Infrastructure (Week 3-4)
1. **Analytics Setup**
   - [ ] Implement basic event tracking (page views, actions)
   - [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry or similar)
   - [ ] Create admin dashboard for metrics

2. **User Feedback**
   - [ ] Add feedback widget
   - [ ] Implement feature request system
   - [ ] Set up user testing sessions

### Sprint 3: Feature Polish (Week 5-6)
1. **Onboarding**
   - [ ] Create welcome tour
   - [ ] Add tooltips for key features
   - [ ] Develop quick-start guide

2. **Project Experience**
   - [ ] Improve project creation flow
   - [ ] Add project templates
   - [ ] Enable project sharing

## Build-Measure-Learn Cycle Completion

### Validation Questions for Next Cycle
1. **Did fixing the /projects error increase project creation rate?**
2. **Does guest access to Scholar increase sign-up conversion?**
3. **Which module do users try first? (Scholar, Writer, Code, Viz)**
4. **What's the drop-off point in the user journey?**

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero critical routing errors
- [ ] >50% of new users create a project within first session
- [ ] >30% of users try 2+ modules
- [ ] <5% error rate across all pages

---

## Notes
- Screenshots reveal a polished UI but functional gaps
- Project-centric design is clear but needs smoother entry path
- Open source positioning is strong - leverage community
- Consider monetization alignment with user value (per MONETIZATION_STRATEGY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

**Next Review:** After Sprint 1 completion
**Measurement Tools Needed:** Analytics platform, error tracking, user feedback system
