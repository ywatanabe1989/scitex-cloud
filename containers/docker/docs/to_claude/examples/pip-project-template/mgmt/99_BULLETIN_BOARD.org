#+TITLE: Bulletin Board Communication
#+AUTHOR: ywatanabe
#+DATE: 2025-08-27
#+UPDATE: Lightweight message-based coordination

* Overview
Agents communicate asynchronously through *lightweight* bulletin board messages:
- No direct coupling between agents
- Natural workflow emerges from message patterns
- Each agent works independently based on their role

* Clean Design Principles
- Messages contain *file paths*, not data
- Large data (test results, specs, architecture) stored as external files
- Message size limited to ~1KB for efficiency

* Example Message Structure
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
message:
  type: "TEST_RESULTS"
  from: "TestingAgent"
  to: ["DeveloperAgent"]
  payload:
    message: "3/5 tests passed"
    results_file: "mgmt/test_results/test_report.json"
    coverage_file: "mgmt/test_results/coverage.json"
    status: "RED"
#+END_SRC
