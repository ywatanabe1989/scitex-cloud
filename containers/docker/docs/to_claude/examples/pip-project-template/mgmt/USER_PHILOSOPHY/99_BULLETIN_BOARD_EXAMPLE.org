#+TITLE: Bulletin Board Communication
#+AUTHOR: ywatanabe
#+DATE: 2025-08-27
#+UPDATE: Lightweight message-based coordination

* Agents List
- AGENT_NAME_01 
- AGENT_NAME_02 
...

* Expectations
Agents communicate asynchronously through *lightweight* bulletin board messages:
- No direct coupling between agents
- Natural workflow emerges from message patterns
- Each agent works independently based on their role

* Clean Design Principles
- Messages contain *file paths*, not data
- Large data (test results, specs, architecture) stored as external files
- Message size limited to ~1KB for efficiency

* Example Messages
